        Marcol Fabrications was established in 1990 by its two directors, Colin
        Vye and Mark Godfrey who have over 50 years combined experience of
        plastic fabrication/engineering. Marcol was incorporated in 1998 and
        since then, Colin and Mark have built a thriving business by putting
        focus on their customers. The company moved to its current premises in
        Nailsea in 1997, approximately 8 miles from Bristol, close to several
        major transport links including Bristol airport.
      </p>

        Marcol has always put the emphasis on its excellent customer service,
        competitive prices and very high quality work.

        In addition to in-house fabrication, Marcol also have an experienced and
        skilled site team with experience working in the UK, Europe and Asia.
        The type of work we do varies from small welding jobs to complete
        bespoke installations of process plants, pipe-work, tanks, scrubbing
        systems etc. which are built and then installed by us on site. Other
        services we offer include design work, a project manager to oversee
        projects, drawing AutoCAD / 3D modelling, and site supervision for our
        operatives. Everything you need to make sure your requirements are met.
        The highest standards are maintained and current legislation is adhered
        to at all times.
